Rawdata readme
This is the raw data folder
The raw data for this project is the manure application dates and field locations, and the S2 images.
The manure application dates are given in the project write up in the main folder. The field locations (geojson aois) are given in the pre-process python notebook code. Thus this folder just contains the images.
